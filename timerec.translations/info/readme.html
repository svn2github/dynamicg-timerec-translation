<h2>Time Recording - Translation Kit</h2>

<br>
<b>What's this</b>
<br>
This is for users who want to help with app translation. The "Translation Kit" allows changing app texts and checking those changes directly within the app. You'll need to be familiar with XML text file editing and saving files to your SD Card.
<br>
Currently supported languages in the app: english, german, french, italian, portuguese, spanish, hungarian
<br>

<br>
<br>
<b>Setup</b>
<ol>
<li>
Get the latest "strings.xml" file from here: <a href="../res/">Resources Folder</a>.
<br/>When starting from scratch, use the english (<a href="..\res\values-en">values-en</a>)
or german (<a href="..\res\values-de">values-de</a>) strings.xml file as template.
<br/> When fixing/enhancing existing translations, use the according strings.xml file - the folder name pattern is "values-[languageCode]", e.g. values-es for spanish, values-pt for portuguese. 
</li>

<li>
Copy the matching strings.xml file to the top level of your SD Card. 
Use the "internal SD Card" if you have more than one (e.g. Samsung devices).
</li>

<li>
Open the app and go to &lt;&lt;Menu / Preferences / Advanced&gt;&gt;.
Click on "Translation Kit" and press "OK". 
Close and reopen the app - you will get an error message if the "strings.xml" file cannot be found.
</li>

</ol>

<br>
<br>
<b>Translation</b>
<ul>

<li>
Contact us at dynamicg.info@gmail.com so that we know which language you're doing the translation for.
</li>

<li>
Edit the "strings.xml" file. Whenever you close/reopen the app, the "strings.xml" file gets reloaded, all changes are reflected immediately.
</li>

<li>
Note you can edit the "strings.xml" directly from your PC: 
attach the phone via USB, open the File Explorer, go to &lt;&lt;Your Device&gt;&gt; / Internal Storage and edit the "strings.xml" file with Wordpad or any other text editor.
</li>

<li>
Some dialogs are only opened conditionally. See &lt;&lt;Menu / Preferences / Advanced / Translation Kit Extra Dialogs&gt;&gt;
</li>

<li>
When you are done with all texts, send your version of the "strings.xml" file to us so we can integrate it into the app 
(zip the file so we don't lose the special characters)
</li>
</ul>

<br>
<br>
<b>Revert</b>
<br/>Go to &lt;&lt;Menu / Preferences / Advanced&gt;&gt;. Tap "Translation Kit" to disable it.

<br>
<br>
<br>
<b>Handling of special characters</b>

<code>
<br/>• &lt;!-- ...text... --&gt; is a comment. ignore these, do not translate
<br/>• \n is a newline. "a\nb" will show as "a[newLine]b"
<br/>• single and double quotes have to be escaped with backslash: \' or \"
<br/>• {1} and {2} are placeholders. "Edit \'{1}\'" may become "Edit 'Tasks'"
<br/>

<br/>• \u.... are utf characters:
<br/>\u2026 = ellipsis [...]
<br/>\u2192 = right arrow [-&gt;]
<br/>\u2022 = bullet
<br/>

<br/>• other special characters
<br/>&amp;amp; = ampersand [&amp;] 
<br/>&amp;lt; = less than [&lt;]
<br/>&amp;gt; = greater than [&gt;]

</code>
