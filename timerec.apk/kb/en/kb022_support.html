<h2>Time Recording: Frequently asked questions</h2>

<br/><b>Does your app also run on iPhone, Windows Mobile or other platforms? Do you have plans for a Web-enabled version?</b>
<br/>No. The app only runs on Android, other versions are neither available nor planned. And yes, that's a final decision.
<br/>

<br/><b>Can I add entries to previous days?</b>
<br/>Yes. <a href="../en/kb026_add_to_previous_days.html">See here</a>.
<br/>

<br/><b>How do I track my holidays?</b>
<br/>The app doesn't have extra functionality for this, but you can use tasks and notes to track and report holidays.
The same applies tracking overtime hours. See these pages:
<br/>• <a href="kb003_holidays.html">KB003: Holidays</a>
<br/>• <a href="kb009_delta_overview.html">KB009: Overview Delta</a>
<br/>

<br/><b>My hourly rate has changed. How do I put this into the app without chaning past entries?</b>
<br/>Create a new task with the according hourly rate and assign your new entries to that.
<br/>If you've alreday used tasks before for the old entries, set that task to "inactive" 
<br/>

<br/><b>Can I use the same task with different clients?</b>
<br/>No. A task belongs to one single client, the app has this strict hierarchy "Work unit =&gt; Task =&gt; Client".
<br/>The only workaround is to create a new task for each combination of 'common task' and client. 
Also see <a href="../en/kb012_tasklist_import.html">KB012: Tasks export and import</a>.
<br/>This is a basic restriction. Right now we don't think the app will ever be able to support this. <i>(1)</i>
<br/>

<br/><b>How can I track 2 jobs?</b>
<br/>Option 1: set up two <a href="../en/kb011_tasks.html">tasks</a> within the app and assign your work time accordingly.
<br/>Option 2: install both "Free" and "Pro" in parallel. Use one app per job.
<br/>- Option 1 allows you to have a grand total overview and is maybe easier to use (everything is in one place). However, you will hit app restrictions if you want to set different global settings per job (e.g. there's only one "weekly target time" or set of OT rules within the app) 
<br/>- Option 2 requires you to buy Pro and have 2 apps installed, but you'll have a clean separation of data and settings (as the two apps will run separate and independently of each other)
<br/>

<br/><b>Does the app support parallel or overlapping entries?</b>
<br/>No. No workaround available.
<br/>Note - if you want to track multiple persons or several "things" (like machinery) see this page:
<a href="http://dynamicg-timerec.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/timerec.apk/instances/readme-en.html">Multi instances</a>
<br/>This is a basic restriction. Right now we don't think the app will ever be able to support this. <i>(1)</i>
<br/>

<br/><b>How do I print my time sheet?</b>
<br/>Go to <a href="../en/kb007_reports.html">Menu/Reports</a> and select one of the reports. 
Pick "E1" or "E2" if you haven't used "Reports" before. This will send your time sheet via email.
<br/>For printing out directly from your phone, make sure you have <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.google.android.apps.cloudprint">Google Cloud Print</a> installed and configured.
<br/>

<br/><b>Is there more help?</b>
<br/>The app doesn't a have a user guide or manual, but there is some more FAQs on <a href="https://sites.google.com/site/androidtimerecording/home">this page</a>.
<br/>


<br/>
<br/>
<br/><b>Foot notes</b>
<br/><i>(1)</i> Yes we realize that for some users this is either a major issue or a show stopper.
However, supporting this feature would require massive changes to the app or a complete rewrite so we don't have this planned.
