<h2>Time Recording: Frequently asked questions</h2>

<br/><b>Does your app also run on iPhone, Windows Mobile or other platforms? Do you have plans for a web-enabled version?</b>
<br/>No. The app only runs on Android, other versions are neither available nor planned. And yes, that's a final decision.
<br/>

<br/><b>How do I track my holidays?</b>
<br/>The app doesn't have extra functionality for this, but you can use tasks and notes to track and report holidays.
The same applies tracking overtime hours. See these pages:
<br/>• <a href="kb003_holidays.html">KB003: Holidays</a>
<br/>• <a href="kb009_delta_overview.html">KB009: Overview Delta</a>
<br/>

<br/><b>My hourly rate has changed. How do I put this into the app without chaning past entries?</b>
<br/>Create a new task with the according hourly rate and assign your new entries to that.
<br/>If you've alreday used tasks before for the old entries, set that task to "inactive" 
<br/>

<br/><b>Can I use the same task with different clients?</b>
<br/>No. A task belongs to one single client, the app has this strict hierarchy "Work unit =&gt; Task =&gt; Client".
<br/>The only workaround is to create a new task for each combination of 'common task' and client. 
Also see <a href="../en/kb012_tasklist_import.html">KB012: Tasks export and import</a>.
<br/>This is a basic restriction. Right now we don't think the app will ever be able to support this. <i>(1)</i>
<br/>

<br/><b>Does the app support parallel or overlapping entries?</b>
<br/>No. No workaround available.
<br/>Note - if you want to track multiple persons or things like machinery see this page:
<a href="http://dynamicg-timerec.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/timerec.apk/instances/readme-en.html">Multi instances</a>
<br/>This is a basic restriction. Right now we don't think the app will ever be able to support this. <i>(1)</i>
<br/>

<br/><b>Is there more help?</b>
<br/>The app doesn't a have a user guide or manual, but there is some more FAQs on <a href="https://sites.google.com/site/androidtimerecording/home">this page</a>.
<br/>


<br/>
<br/>
<br/><b>Foot notes</b>
<br/><i>(1)</i> Yes we realize that for some users this is either a major issue or even a show stopper.
However, supporting this feature would require massive changes to the app or a complete rewrite so we don't have this planned.
