<h2>Time Recording</h2>

<b>Pull reports</b>
<br>
• Go to "Menu / Reports". Alternatively do a long click on the Day, Week or Month button
<br>
• Tap one of the reports: 
<br>- click the report name (marked red) to send out the report - also see next section
<br>- click the "Preview" icon (marked blue) to preview a report directly on your phone without sending it out 
<br>- each report has detailed settings (tap the icon marked green)

<b>Report settings: output and delivery</b>
<br>
• Reports are either delivered as email attachment or uploaded to Google Drive or Dropbox.
<br>
• Report output formats:
<br>- "HTML" is most convenient for plain viewing or simple printouts.
Also note <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.google.android.apps.cloudprint">Google Cloud Print</a> which allows to send these HTML reports directly to a printer. 
<br>- "XLS" is the Microsoft Excel spreadsheet format. Use this if you want to import your timesheet data into MS Excel or Open Office.
<br>- "CSV" is a plain text file with comma-separated field data. This is for backwards compatibility (native XLS format has only been added with app version 5.10), new users should stick with either HTML or XLS.
<br>- "XML" is for developers

<br>
<br>
<b>CSV trouble shooting</b>
<br>• If CSV import does not work (i.e. all data imported as one cell) try changing the output format to "XLS" (see above).
<br>• Alternatively, try changing the CSV control characters. Also, if you're losing special characters (e.g. Umlauts) try changing the "File encoding":
