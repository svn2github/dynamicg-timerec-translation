<br>• Click the "Play Store" link to re-validate your Time Recording Pro license. You need to be online for that.
<br>• If you have switched your Google Account recently:
make sure the "old" Google Account (i.e. the one you have used to buy the app with) is added to your phone.
<br>Also see this page: <a href="https://support.google.com/googleplay/answer/113410">https://support.google.com/googleplay/answer/113410</a>
<br>• The "License not valid" message only kicks in after repeated license validation failures, i.e. this message will typically show a few weeks after account switch.
<br>• Important: As of now, Google does <b>not</b> support transferring app licenses to another account.
If you need to have the app license assigned to a new Google account then you'll need to buy the app again.
<br>• Check your purchase history in Play Store if you're not sure which account you've purchased the app with:
<a href="https://play.google.com/store/account">https://play.google.com/store/account</a>
