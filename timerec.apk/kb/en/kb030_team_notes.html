<h2>Time Recording</h2>

Noteworthy things for using Time Recording with your team or peers:

<br>
<br>• For tracking multiple persons on one device: try with the <a href="http://dynamicg-timerec.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/timerec.apk/instances/readme-en.html">Multi instances</a>.

<br>
<br>• Sharing your task list: <a href="../en/kb012_tasklist_import.html">Tasks Export and Import</a>
<br>Also note that through <a href="../en/kb027_automation_app.html">NFC Automation</a> tasks can be propagated (since the task and client name are stored directly on the NFC tag).

<br>
<br>• Changing the default file names of the Time Recording reports:
<br>- go to the Reports screen, tap <a href="../en/kb007_reports.html">Menu/Settings</a>.
<br>- on Page 2 change the "Filename prefix" property, e.g. put your employee short code in there, or similar
<br>Also note the reports can be uploaded directly to Google Drive or Dropbox (default setting is "Send as email attachment").

<br>
<br>• If your employees forget to send in their reports on time: 
have them install and use the <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.dynamicg.reportscheduler">Report Reminder</a>.

<br>
<br>• For importing your data and settings on new devices for simplified setup:
<br>(1) Preparation:
<br>Pull a backup on your master device and copy the resulting "timerec.db.gz" to a web server. Or alternatively send out that backup file as email attachment to your peers.
<br>(2) On each target device:
<br>- Install this app:
<a href="https://dynamicgandroidapps.svn.cloudforge.com/main/instances-mirror/tools/TimeRecBackupDispatcher.apk">TimeRec Backup Dispatcher</a>
<br>- Open the "timerec.db.gz" file from step 1: either by opening the according web location (URL) in the mobile web browser, or by downloading the according email attachment using the Email app.
<br>=&gt; The "Backup Dispatcher" app from step 2 will now kick in and send the user to the according "Time Recording / Restore data and settings" screen for the given backup file.
